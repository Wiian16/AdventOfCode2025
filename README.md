# Advent of Code 2025

This repository holds my submissions for the (Advent of Code 2025)[https://adventofcode.com/]. Since I couldn't decide
which language to complete it in, I've chosen to attempt in both Rust and Java! I hope to learn more about the Rust
language and to keep my skills sharp in Java. You'll be able to find my submissions for each day in the `Rust/` or 
`Java/` directories here.
